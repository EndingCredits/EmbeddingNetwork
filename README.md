# Set networks

This is a collection of tensorflow implementations of various permutation-invariant networks and network components. These implementations are not 100% faithful to their original implementations (either described in papers or from other repositories).

This repo is primarily for my own use, but feel free to use any components in your own projects and/or submit a PR with any additional comonents you feel are worthy of addition.
